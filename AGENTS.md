# AGENTS.md

## Instructions for AI and automated contributors

- Run `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, and `npm test` before committing.
- Use TypeScript with React and adhere to the project's existing ESLint and Stylelint configurations.
- Commit messages should start with a short imperative summary line.
- New `AGENTS.md` files in subdirectories may override these rules for their respective paths.
